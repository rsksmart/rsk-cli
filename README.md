# rsk-cli

## Description

`rsk-cli` is a command-line tool for interacting with Rootstock blockchain

## Installation

To install the CLI tool globally, use the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @rsksmart/rsk-cli
```

## Development

### Prerequisites

Before you can start developing with `rsk-cli`, ensure that you have the following tools installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed, as it is required for running the CLI tool.

## Features

### 1. Manage Wallet

The `wallet` command allows you to manage your wallet on the Rootstock blockchain. You can create a new wallet, use an existing wallet, or import a custom wallet.

```bash
rsk-cli wallet
```

This command will guide you through the process of wallet management, offering options to:

- Create a new Ethereum-compatible wallet
- Import an existing wallet
- List all saved wallets
- Switch between saved wallets
- Update a wallet's name
- Backup the wallet's file
- Delete a saved wallet

> **ℹ️ Info:**
>
> When you choose to save a wallet using `rsk-cli`, your private key is securely encrypted to protect it from unauthorized access.
>
> The tool uses AES-256-CBC encryption, a robust encryption standard. Your password is used to derive a strong encryption key through the `scrypt` function, ensuring that even weak passwords result in strong keys. A random Initialization Vector (IV) is also generated to ensure that even if the same data is encrypted multiple times, the output will be different each time.
>
> After encryption, your wallet's private key, along with the necessary encryption metadata, is securely stored in a file named `rootstock-wallet.json` in the current working directory. This file allows you to manage and reuse your wallets securely within `rsk-cli` without exposing your sensitive private keys.

- Example output when creating a new wallet:

  ```

### 2. Check Balance

The `balance` command allows you to check the balance of any token on the Rootstock blockchain for any of the saved wallets. You can check the balance on either the mainnet or testnet using the appropriate flags.

#### Mainnet

```bash
rsk-cli balance
```

Output example:

```
? Select token to check balance: RIF
✔ Balance retrieved successfully
📄 Token Information:
     Name: RIF Token

  💰 Balance: 0.02 RIF
  🌐 Network: Rootstock Mainnet
🔗 Ensure that transactions are being conducted on the correct network.
```

#### Testnet

Use the `-t` or `--testnet` flag to check the balance on the Rootstock testnet.

```bash
rsk-cli balance -t
```

Output example:

```
? Select token to check balance: RIF
✔ Balance retrieved successfully
📄 Token Information:

```

#### Dynamic Wallet Selection

Use the `--wallet` flag to dynamically select the wallet.

```bash
rsk-cli balance --wallet <name>
```

### 3. Transfer (RBTC and ERC20)

The `transfer` command allows you to transfer both RBTC and ERC20 tokens from your saved wallet to a specified address on the Rootstock blockchain. You can execute transfers on either mainnet or testnet using the appropriate flags.

#### Interactive Mode

Use the `-i` or `--interactive` flag to enter transfer details interactively:

```bash
# Interactive mode on testnet
rsk-cli transfer --testnet -i

# Interactive mode on mainnet
rsk-cli transfer -i
```

### 10. Pipe Commands

The `pipe` command allows you to chain multiple commands together, enabling powerful workflows where the output of one command automatically becomes the input for the next command. This feature is particularly useful for automating common blockchain operations.

#### Basic Syntax

```bash
rsk-cli pipe "command1 [options] | command2 [options]"
```

#### Examples

**Transfer and Check Status**
Execute a transfer and automatically check the transaction status:

```bash
rsk-cli pipe "transfer --testnet --address 0x8A0d290b2EE35eFde47810CA8fF057e109e4190B --value 0.001 | tx --testnet"
```

**Deploy and Verify Contract**
Deploy a smart contract and automatically verify it:

```bash
rsk-cli pipe "deploy --abi contract.abi --bytecode contract.bin --testnet | verify --json input.json --name MyContract --testnet"
```

**Transfer Token and Check Status**
Transfer an ERC20 token and check the transaction status:

```bash
rsk-cli pipe "transfer --testnet --token 0x32Cd6c5831531F96f57d1faf4DDdf0222c4Af8AB --address 0x8A0d290b2EE35eFde47810CA8fF057e109e4190B --value 0.001 | tx --testnet"
```

#### Supported Command Chains

The pipe command currently supports the following command combinations:

- **transfer → tx**: Transfer RBTC or tokens and check transaction status
- **deploy → verify**: Deploy a contract and verify it on the explorer
- **transfer → tx → verify**: Transfer, check status, and verify (if applicable)

#### How It Works

1. The pipe command parses the command string and splits it by the `|` character
2. Each command is executed sequentially
3. The output data from the first command is automatically passed to the second command
4. For example, when using `transfer | tx`, the transaction hash from the transfer is automatically used as input for the tx command

#### Data Flow

- **transfer** outputs: `transactionHash`, `from`, `to`, `amount`, `token`, `network`
- **deploy** outputs: `contractAddress`, `transactionHash`, `network`
- **tx** accepts: `transactionHash` (from previous command or --txid option)
- **verify** accepts: `contractAddress` (from previous command or --address option)

#### Error Handling

If any command in the pipe fails, the entire pipe execution stops and displays the error message. This ensures that subsequent commands don't execute with invalid data.
